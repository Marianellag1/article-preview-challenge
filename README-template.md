### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [devcamp](https://devcamp.com/trails/javascript-in-the-browser/campsites/javascript-dom/guides/how-to-use-javascript-s-toggle-function) - Really good site for some simple example on javascript code for the toggle part of the challenge.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_toggle_class) - Also a good site. This one is useful for onclick button on html.
- [CODECONVEY](https://codeconvey.com/css-message-box-with-arrow/) - Great site for bottom arrow on share box.

## Acknowledgments

Credit where credit is due. A big part of where my code came after a while struggling with how to start on javascript and how to go about it, is with [borys25ol](https://github.com/borys25ol/frontend-mentor-challenges/blob/master/article-preview-component/index.html). Looking at his code helped extremely on what I can do better on my code, as well as how javascript should work. Expecially when using Devtools.
